# Task 1: Export SQL Data to CSV, Parquet, and Avro

### Objective

Export data from SQL tables (`Customers`, `Products`) to three formats: CSV, Parquet, and Avro.

###  Pipeline Overview

* 6 Copy activities:

  * 3 for `Customers`: CSV, Parquet, Avro
  * 3 for `Products`: CSV, Parquet, Avro
* Sink: Azure Blob Storage

#  Task 2: Configure Schedule and Event Triggers

###  Objective

Automate the pipeline from Task 1 using:

* A **Schedule Trigger** (runs daily at 9 AM IST)
* An **Event Trigger** (fires when `.txt` files are uploaded to Blob)

###  Trigger Setup

* **Schedule Trigger:** `DailyExportTrigger`
* **Event Trigger:** `BlobEventTrigger` (Event Grid based)

##  Task 3: Copy All Tables from One Database to Another

###  Objective

Replicate all base tables from `customerdb` to `customerdb_copy`.

### âš™ Key Components

* Lookup: Gets list of all base tables
* ForEach: Iterates over tables
* Copy Activity: Dynamically uses table names
* Parameters: Used in source and sink datasets

#  Task 4: Selective Copy (Specific Tables and Columns)

### Objective

Use a JSON config file to copy **specific tables and columns** only (e.g., `Customers` with only `CustomerID`, `Name`, etc.)

###  How It Works

* `config.json` stored in Blob
* Dataset reads JSON config
* ForEach iterates through config rows
* SQL query is dynamically built with SELECT column list
